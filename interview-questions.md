# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

Your answer: A hash in ruby is pretty much like an object and has key value pairs.  An example would be [(fruit => apple), vegetable => carrot].  You can also use colons instead of the ruby rocket to assign each value to the key.

Researched answer: AFter a little research a ruby hash is a collection of unique keys and their values.  A hash is like an array but the way it determines its indexes are by the keys. Another interesting fact is that the default value for a hash is nil.

2. What is a gem?

Your answer: A gem is a library like yarn. It is specific to ruby itself and helps with language.

Researched answer: A gem is a package manager that helps with downloading from different libraries that work with the ruby programming language.  It acts like yarn and helps add dependencies on which library you are calling on.

3. What is Ruby on Rails?

Your answer: Ruby on rails is like React.  It is a server-side application that is written with ruby instead of javascript. It uses the ruby programming language to do what javascript does for React which is to shape and use data that you are adding to the application itself.

Researched answer: After some research I found that Ruby on Rails is an open-sourced fullstack framework that has all the tools to help you really design a web app using the ruby language.  It is like react in the sense it is server side web application but as stated before its written in the programming language of ruby.

4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: A relational database is a database that stores alot of different data into tables.  Then inside the database it shows the relations between the two different tables.  A quick example will be the database that I made earlier in the week by making a model for people and a modle for credit cards.  Then I made relationships between the two tables.  For example one person could have 3 cards and you would see that. As to if there are other databases there are another example of a database besides relational is an Obeject-Oriented database.

Researched answer: A relational database is a data base that stores information into tables that already have predefined relationships to others so that they will for a relationship when they are added to the new tables. There are many different kinds of databases some including, Personal database, Commericial database, NoSQl database, and Open-source database.  These are just some and there are even more out there.

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: Primary keys are a way for a database to assign a unique integer to a piece of information that it will not share with any other type of data.  Its important because now every piece of data has a unique identifier and makes it easier to access it or even compare it with other and not be confused that it could be the wrong data since each piece has its own unique primary key and does not share with any other.  An example of how its useful is if I'm looking for a certian piece of data in tens of thousands of data that could be fairly similar.  If I know the primary key of that certian data I can use that to pull up it and now have to dig through tens of thousands of data trying to find it.

Researched answer: A primary key is a special relational database table column that is used to quickly go through data. A good example I found was that lets says you are looking up things sold on Jan 1 and you can tell by the order of the primary keys of when it was sold since the oldest will be the smaller number because of how the data is stored.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: It is a way to map between HTTP vebs, controller and CRUD databases. Not sure what it means but I'm excited since it is more back end!

2. JSON: It is a way to store and transport data. JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation.  It uses value pairs and arrays to help transport and store data

3. ERB: It is a templating language for ruby that allows you to mix HTML and ruby.

4. Params: They are objects that act like hashes but it lets you use symbols and strings interchangeably 

5. API: API stands for Application Programmin Interface and essentially allows to applications to talk to each other.
